                    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most
                    basic building block of the Web. It defines the
                    meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies
                    besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's
                    appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior
                    (JavaScript).

                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking
                     web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article
                      explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also
                       covers some key terms about the language.

                    JavaScript is a scripting or programming language 
                    that allows you to implement complex features on web
                    pages — every time a web page does more than just
                    sit there and display static information for you 
                    to look at — displaying timely content updates,
                    interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
                    scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet
                    that JavaScript is probably involved. It is 
                    the third layer of the layer cake of standard
                    web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS)
                    we have covered in much more detail in other
                    parts of the Learning Area.

                    React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a
                    free and open-source front-end JavaScript library
                    for building user interfaces based on components.
                    It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a
                    community of individual developers and companies.

                    Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can
                     run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript
                      engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
